# Contributing to min-consistency-models

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Getting Started

- Fork the repo and clone it on your machine.
- Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/myNewFeature`).

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to our code? You can start by looking through the "TODO" list in the README.md or issues labeled "help wanted".

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build through `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes, this includes new features, further documentation, or possible TODOs.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Setting Up Development Environment

The repository is currently (and purposefully) very lightweight. `requirements.txt` is all you need!

## Community and Communication

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate, and try to reduce verbosity and annotate your code as much as possible

Thank you for contributing!
